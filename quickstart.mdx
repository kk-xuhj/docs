## Choose your role

BenchFlow aims to be the bridge between benchmark users and benchmark developers. Please choose a role to start your BenchFlow journey.

### For benchmark users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the benchflow sdk">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash pip
      git clone https://github.com/benchflow-ai/benchflow.git
      cd benchflow
      pip install benchflow
      ```

      ```bash uv
      git clone https://github.com/benchflow-ai/benchflow.git
      cd benchflow
      uv add --editable benchflow
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your benchmarks">
    Discover benchmarks tailored to your needs on <a href="https://staging.benchflow.ai/dashboard/benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benchmark Hub</a>.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement your call_api">
    Extend the <a href="https://github.com/benchflow-ai/benchflow/blob/main/src/benchflow/BaseAgent.py">BaseAgent</a> interface. `call_api` is used to call your intelligence (LLM, Agent ...)

    ```python YourAgent.py
    from benchflow import BaseAgent

    class YourAgent(BaseAgent):
      def call_api(self, task_step_inputs):
        ...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your benchmark">
    Run your benchmark in a seperate script.

    Kickstart your free BenchFlow trial on <a href="https://benchflow.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BenchFlow.ai</a> to unlock benchmarking insights.

    ```python
    from benchflow import load_benchmark
    from YourAgent import YourAgent

    benchmark_name="organization/selected_benchmark", 
    bf_token=os.getenv("BF_TOKEN")
    bench = load_benchmark(benchmark_name, bf_token)

    your_agent = YourAgent()

    run_ids = bench.run(
        task_ids=[0],                   # Run the task with IDs
        agents=your_agents,             # Your agent
        api={                           # Your provider API configuration
            "provider": "",
            "model": "",
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
        },
        requirements_txt="requirements.txt",  # Extra dependencies
        args={}                         # Arguments for your benchmarks
    )

    results = bench.get_results(run_ids)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For benchmark developers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the benchflow sdk">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript helloWorld.js
      console.log("Hello World");
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your benchmark a client">
    ```python
    from benchflow import BenchClient

    class YourClient(BenchClient):
      def prepare_input(self, raw_step_inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> dict:
        # Each benchmark should supply a dataset for task step as a dict. 
        # For example, if your benchmark is a Q&A dataset, your returned dictionary should include at least a "question" key. 
        # You can also include any additional fields contained in your dataset.
        ...
      
      def parse_response(self, raw_response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        ...
        
    # Then you can use your Client in your evaluation script
    # For example:
    client = YourClient()

    for steps in your_task_steps:
      env = {"question": "question text", "hint": "hint"}
      response = client.run_bench(env)

    score = your_eval_method(response)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Containerize your benchmark">
    Package your benchmark as an image and provide an entry point to run the benchmark.&#x20;

    <Check>
      Please configure your Docker image to target the Linux platform. We plan to support additional platforms in future releases.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extend BaseBench to Run Your Benchmarks">
    Implement your subclass in `benchflow_interface.py` and upload it to benchmark Hub.
    There are 6 methods to be implemented.&#x20;

    <Note>
      5 of them are very simple and can often be implemented with just a return statement. The only one that might take a bit of time is the `get_result` method.
    </Note>

    ```python
    from benchflow import BaseBench
    from benchflow.schemas import BenchArgs, BenchmarkResult

    class YourBench(BaseBench):
      def get_args(task_id) -> BenchArgs:
         ...
      def get_image_name(self) -> str:
         ...
      def get_results_dir_in_container(self) -> str:
         ...
      def get_log_files_dir_in_container(self) -> str:
         ...
      def get_result(self, task_id: str) -> BenchmarkResult:
         ...
      def get_all_tasks(self, split: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
         ...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload your benchmark to Benchmark Hub">
    Here’s your checklist:

    1. **benchflow\_interface.py** - ensure your file is named correctly.\*\*\*\*&#x20;

    2. **readme.md** – This should showcase the field formats provided in the `prepare_input method`from Step 2, along with detailed descriptions.
  </Step>
