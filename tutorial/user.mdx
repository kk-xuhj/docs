## Benchmark your intelligence

**Intelligence** is any AI-related product (e.g.LLM models, AI agents ...).&#x20;

Benchflow use the api provided by your intelligence to help you rapidly build a benchmark pipeline without any benchmark setup.

## Install benchflow sdk

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash uv
  uv add benchflow
  ```

  ```bash pip
  pip install benchflow
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Implement the interface for api

### Import the interface for api

You need to implement the **BaseAgen**t interface provided by benchflow.

```python
from benchflow import BaseAgent
```

<Note>
  Although this interface is named BaseAgent, **you don’t need to design an AI agent**; simply implementing the call\_api method is sufficient. We call it an “agent” because it serves as an agent to invoke your API.
</Note>

### Check the benchmark card

Go to the Benchmark Hub and read **model card** about the benchmarks you want to test on, especially the **task\_step\_input** provided by the benchmark developer.

<Check>
  The **`task_step_input`** is a dictionary provided as input to the **`call_api`** method that contains all the benchmark dataset information. You will need to use it to test your intelligence.
</Check>

### Implement your call\_api function

Here is a basic example about testing the OpenAI on a Q\&A benchmark. Suppose the model card specifies that the format of `task_step_inputs` is `{"question": "question text"}`.

```python openai_caller.py
from openai import OpenAI
from benchflow import BaseAgent

class YourCaller(BaseAgent):
  def call_api(self, task_step_inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
      messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": task_step_inputs['question']}
      ]
      client = OpenAI(
         api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
      )
      response = client.chat.completions.create(
         messages=messages,
         model="gpt-4o",
         temperature=0.9,
      )
      content = response.choices[0].message.content
      return content
```

<Note>
  Please implement this interface in a separate file. In the future, we will support more flexible implementation approaches.
</Note>

## Run the benchmark

### Create the environment for calling your api

We require you to provide a Python-style **`requirements.txt`** file that lists all dependencies needed to call your API. For instance, in the **`openai_caller.py`** , your `requirements.txt` should include the following dependencies:

```
openai
benchflow
```

### Get your BenchFlow token

Kickstart your free BenchFlow trial on <a href="https://benchflow.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BenchFlow.ai</a> to unlock benchmarking insights.

### Benchmark your intelligence

Load your benchmark from benchmark hub.

```python
from benchflow import load_benchmark
bench = load_benchmark("benchflow/webarena", bf_token=os.getenv(BF_TOKEN))
```

<Note>
  The naming format for benchmarks is **`organization_name/benchmark_name`**
</Note>

Import your api caller (agent).

```python
from api_caller import YourCaller

agent = YourCaller()
```

Start the benchmark tasks.

```python
# Refer to the fileds description below for more details
run_ids = bench.run(
        task_ids=[0],
        agents=agent,
        api={
            "provider": "openai", 
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini", 
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        },
        requirements_txt="webarena_requirements.txt",
        args={}
    )
```

<Accordion title="Fields Description" defaultOpen={false} icon="info" iconType="solid">
  * **task\_ids:**

    A list that specifies which task(s) to run. If you leave this list empty, the system defaults to running the full benchmark. For the precise format, please refer to the model card.

  * **agents:**

    An instance of your agent that implements the `call_api` method.&#x20;

  * **api:**

    A dictionary containing the API configuration details. **This should includes the provider name, model, and any necessary API keys.**&#x20;

  * **requirements\_txt:**

    A file path to your dependencies file formatted like a standard `requirements.txt`. This file should list all the Python dependencies needed for your API calls.

  * **args:**

    A dictionary for any **required** and **optional** arguments required by your benchmark. Please refer to the model card on the benchmark hub.
</Accordion>

### Get your results

You can get your results from our sdk:

```
 results = bench.get_results(run_ids)
```

or download the results from [BenchFlow.ai dashborad](https://staging.benchflow.ai/dashboard/jobs).
