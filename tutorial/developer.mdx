  <Card title="BenchClient" icon="sparkles">
    BenchClient make your benchmark as a client, which enables seamless interaction with the intelligence through HTTP. It should be embedded into the evaluation entrance.

  <Card title="BaseBench" icon="sparkles">
    BaseBench is an interface for running, managing, and displaying benchmark results. All benchmark outputs are unified, enabling standardized visualization on BenchFlow.
  </Card>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash uv
  uv add benchflow
  ```

  ```bash pip
  pip install benchflow
  ```
</CodeGroup>
